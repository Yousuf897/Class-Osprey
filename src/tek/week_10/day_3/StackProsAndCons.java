    * Pros of Using a Stack:

    LIFO Behavior: Stacks are suitable for modeling scenarios where the order of processing or access should follow the Last-In-First-Out behavior.

    Simple Implementation: Stacks are relatively easy to implement and understand, making them useful for a wide range of applications.

    Efficient for Certain Operations: Pushing and popping elements onto/from a stack are very efficient operations with a constant time complexity.

    Cons of Using a Stack:

    Limited Usage: Stacks are not well-suited for all types of data access patterns. They are primarily used in specific scenarios where LIFO behavior is required.

    No Random Access: Unlike arrays or lists, stacks don't provide random access to elements. You can only access the top element.

    Potential Stack Overflow: If elements are pushed onto a stack without proper control, it can lead to a stack overflow error, especially in recursive algorithms.

    In summary, a stack in Java is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and is used for specific scenarios where this behavior is required.
*  It is implemented using various classes, and it provides efficient push and pop operations. However, it may not be suitable for all data access patterns.
