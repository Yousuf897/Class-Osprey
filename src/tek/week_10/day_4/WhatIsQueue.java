    *
    * A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue
    * will be the first element to be removed. Think of a queue as a real-life queue or line (like in a bank or grocery checkout) â€” the first person to
    *  get in line is the first person to be served.

    In Java, the Queue interface represents this data structure and is a part of the Java Collections Framework. The Queue interface provides methods for
    * performing standard queue operations:

    add(e): Inserts the specified element into the queue. Throws an exception if the operation fails (e.g., if the queue is bounded and full).

    offer(e): Inserts the specified element into the queue, returning true if the operation succeeds and false otherwise.

    remove(): Retrieves and removes the head of the queue. Throws an exception if the queue is empty.

    poll(): Retrieves and removes the head of the queue, or returns null if the queue is empty.

    element(): Retrieves but does not remove the head of the queue. Throws an exception if the queue is empty.

    peek(): Retrieves but does not remove the head of the queue, or returns null if the queue is empty.
