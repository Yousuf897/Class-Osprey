    * An Exception is a problem that can occur during the normal flow of an execution. A method can throw an exception when something wails at runtime.
    * If that exception couldnâ€™t be handled, then the execution gets terminated before it completes the task. If we handled the exception,
    *  then the normal flow gets continued. Exceptions are a subclass of java.lang.Exception.
