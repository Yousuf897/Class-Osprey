/*  For-Each Loop (Enhanced For Loop)

    Real-Life Analogy:

    Imagine you have a basket of fruits: apple, banana, orange, and grape. Instead of picking a fruit
    by its position in the basket, you simply want to go through each fruit one by one. For each fruit
    you pick, you examine it and then move to the next one, until you've examined all the fruits in the
    basket.

    Programming Explanation:

    In Java, when you want to iterate over all the elements in an array or a collection without
    needing to know the index of the current item, you can use the for-each loop, also known as
    the enhanced for loop. It simplifies the syntax and avoids potential errors related to indexes.

    The structure of a for-each loop is:

    for (Type variableName : arrayOrCollection) {
        // body of the loop
    }
*/


}
