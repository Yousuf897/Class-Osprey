/*

    You have to give each variable a name so you can use it later in your program.

    There are rules and best practices for naming:

    1. Variable names should be descriptive (e.g., userName, totalAmount).
    2. They cannot start with numbers or special characters except for underscores or dollar signs.
    3. Java is case-sensitive, so age and Age would be different variables.
