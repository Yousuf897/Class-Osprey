    Imagine you've built a toy car and now you want to make sure it can actually roll without falling apart,
    or that its remote control works as expected. Testing is similar in the world of software. You want to check
    that your code does what it's supposed to do under various conditions.

    Java plays a big role in the world of software testing, and here's how:

    1. JUnit: Think of JUnit like the "crash test" facility for your Java programs. JUnit is a popular framework
    used for writing tests in Java. It allows you to check that individual pieces of your code (like methods or
    classes) are working correctly.

    2. Selenium: Imagine being able to hire a robot to play with the toy car you built, testing all the buttons
    and driving it around to make sure everything works well. Selenium does something similar for web applications.
    It can automate a web browser to perform actions like clicking buttons, filling out forms, etc.,
    and it can be scripted using Java.

    3. Test Automation: Java's robustness and libraries make it a go-to language for automated testing.
     Imagine a factory production line where each toy car is automatically tested for defects.
     In a similar fashion, Java can help automate complex test scenarios for large software systems.

    Mocking: Sometimes, you want to test just one piece of your toy car, like its wheels, without worrying
    about other parts like the remote control. In Java, you can use libraries like Mockito to "mock" parts of
     the system, so you can test individual components in isolation.

    Integration Testing: After testing the wheels, the remote control, and other individual parts, you'd want
    to test the whole toy car together. Java also facilitates this kind of "integration testing" where you test
    multiple components as a single unit.

    Load and Performance Testing: You'd also want to make sure your toy car can handle rough surfaces or go
    at high speeds without falling apart. Similarly, tools like Apache JMeter can be used with Java to
    simulate heavy loads on software applications to test their performance.
