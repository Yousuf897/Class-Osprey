    What is IDE?

    Imagine you're an artist. You could technically paint on any surface using any kind of brush or even your
    fingers, but having a proper canvas, easel, and a set of brushes makes the job a whole lot easier and more
    organized. Similarly, when you're writing Java code (or code in other languages), you could use a basic text
    editor, but an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, intelliJ offers a much more powerful
    and convenient workspace.
