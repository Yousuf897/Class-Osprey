    *   1. Ask the user to enter the numbers, or you can manually assign the values to variables
    *   2. You need a space to store those numbers (space means variable (box) )
    *   3. I need another location or space (box) variable in order to store the max number based on the condition
    *   4. if X is bigger than Y -> store the X into maximum variable
    *   5. else it means Y is the bigger number -> store the Y into maximum variable
