    Imagine going to a department store where they offer gift registrations.
    To get information about the gifts you've registered for, you would give your
    details to the store representative. The representative would then enter this data into
    their system to retrieve and display the list of gifts. In this scenario, the act of the
    representative collecting details from you is analogous to the Scanner in Java, which collects
    input from the user.

    In Java, the Scanner class provides a way to read input of various types from different sources,
    like the keyboard or files. Most commonly for beginners, it's used to read input from the standard
     input, which usually means the keyboard.

    To use the Scanner class, you must first import it from the java.util package:

    import java.util.Scanner;

    After that, you can create an instance (object or copy ) of the Scanner class and use its methods
    to read different types of data.


    Examples:

    Reading a String:

    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Enter your name:");
    String name = input.nextLine();
    System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");


    Reading an Integer:

    System.out.println("Enter your age:");
    int age = input.nextInt();
    System.out.println("You are " + age + " years old.");


    Reading a Double:

    System.out.println("Enter the price of the item:");
    double price = input.nextDouble();
    System.out.println("The price is: $" + price);

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String firstName;
        char character;
        double salary;

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        firstName = input.nextLine();
        salary = input.nextDouble();

        System.out.println( "Your firstName is: " + firstName );

        // int --> nextInt();
        // double --> nextDouble();
        // String --> nextLine();
        // Single line String --> next();
        // short --> nextShort();
    }

}
