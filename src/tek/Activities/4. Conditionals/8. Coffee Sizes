8. Coffee Sizes:
In a coffee shop application, customers can choose a size for their coffee: "Small", "Medium", "Large", or "Extra Large". Use a switch case based on a coffeeSize string variable to display the price of the coffee:

    Small: "$2"
    Medium: "$3"
    Large: "$4"
    Extra Large: "$5"
    For any other input, display "We don't serve that size here".
