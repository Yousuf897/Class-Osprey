1. Basic Decision Making:
You are creating a weather application. Based on the temperature, suggest what to wear. If the temperature is below 10 degrees, display "Wear a heavy coat!". If it's between 10 and 20 degrees, suggest "A light jacket will do.". Otherwise, for any temperature above 20 degrees, show "It's warm, just a T-shirt is fine!".
